                    ‘Transcosmogram’ is a materialised metaphor— a map obtained by highlighting tangents encompassing the multimodal stratum of knowledges—where we reimagine and reposition the human in the context of astronomy.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The notion of ‘transcosmogram’ emerged from the lack of depiction of dimensionalities in the human interpretation of space and the cosmos.
                    <br>
                    With the spirit of de-engtangling and composing all seemingly dividing boundaries, the intention of a ‘transcosmogram’ is to delineate a ‘’map’’ emerged from discovering and highlighting the tangents that connect these strata of our known space(s), i.e., consisting of the terrestrial and organic layers, e.g., sedimentary, atmospheric layers of the earth, and the technospheric layer, including space junk, and cosmological layers.
                    <br>
                    By tapping into the position and relationality between these layers/ elements and illustrating the relationships that exist within them, this approach emancipates us from our own prejudices regarding national, gender, economic, and other boundaries, fostering a sense of cosmic unity.

                The enchanting Earth is too-often made inhospitable to those marked as transgender. To survive we xenomogrify ourselves through social and biological technologies, altering our surfaces, our viscera, our molecular balances. None of us have been to space even if we possess somatic knowledges of deep bodily transformations, experiences that are necessary for extraterrestrial environments.
            </p>
            <p>
                TX-1 launched bits of my hormone replacement medications to the International Space Station (ISS), marking the first-known time that elements of the transgender experience orbited the Earth. TX-1 includes a fragment of my spironolactone pill, a slice of my estradiol patch, and a miniature handmade paper sculpture, included to gesture towards the absent-yet-present xenoentities of the cosmos. A symbolic exodus to an orbit high above, the return of  TX-1 to Earth was also a sign of resilience, of not being disposed of, of coming back to thrive once again. 
            </p>
            <p>
                TX-1 flew to the ISS as part of the Sojourner 2020 project of the MIT Space Exploration Initiative, which provided the launch opportunity to nine artist-groups who were selected from an international open call. You truly never go to space alone.
            </p>
            <p>
                While space is, in many ways, one of the most inhospitable places for life, it simultaneously holds an aura—naïve, perhaps—as a place of transformation where the usual constraints of life on earth can be refashioned, where those who are tranxxeno can exist without earthly prejudices. Some early trans\* activism even expressed desires for connection with extraterrestrial beings, suggesting kinship predicated on being seen as alien. Such cosmological allies thus evince the yearning for acceptance of the Other. These stories that we tell about space are of course simultaneously stories that we tell about earth, and thus TX-1, in line with this earlier activism, manifests a dream of acceptance of the tranxxeno as we move through these transitioning times.

                There are a plethora of theories and data that remain two dimensional, all stacked on top of each other, unreachable from the general public. Sensorial (In)verse is an attempt to bridge this distance and produce an immersive experience of the novel astronomical observations visible for all. It is an installation that allows users to explore the movement of stars in the Orion constellation over time. It does this through gestural control and produces an interactive audio-visual representation of the data.

            <h3>Astronomical Data</h3>
            <p>
                Astrometry, the science of charting the sky, is one of the oldest branches of astronomy and a discipline in which Europe excels. The European Space Agency (ESA) pioneered space astrometry with the Hipparcos Mission (launched in 1989) and, more recently, with the Gaia Mission (launched in 2013). Gaia is a project initiated by ESA to produce a three-dimensional map of our Milky Way galaxy by charting the motions of a thousand million stars, their luminosity, composition and temperature. This mission aims to provide a more in depth knowledge about the origin of the universe as well as the evolutionary history of our galaxy. The data derived by Gaia provides novel positional and radial velocity measurements and enables us to fathom our positionality in this vast cosmos.
            </p><p>
                In order to make astronomical data be accessible for a broader audience, Sensorial (In)verse translates the data derived from ESA’s Hipparcos Mission (representative of the Gaia data for the initial prototype) in the form of an interactive installation and represents it in a multimedia framework. This astrometry representation would enable better understanding of the mapping of the life path of the clusters and much more awareness about earth’s positionality within the galaxy.

            Another Moon&nbsp;is a large-scale outdoor apparition that creates a technically sublime floating globe made from light in the sky. 40 towers collect the sun's energy during the day and project that light back into the sky at night, creating a second moon overhead where the beams tightly superimpose to create the three-dimensional form. The project was presented in the industrial ruins of the Zeche Zollverein (historically the most productive coal mine in Europe). The public artwork could be viewed up to 1km away, creating a focus to bring people back together in a post-corona era.&nbsp;<br><br>Each night the lasers turn off one by one as their batteries deplete, in relation to how much sunshine there was on that particular day. This mechanism replays the fragile energy of the day, unwinding our on-demand instinct for energy that became prevalent during the era of coal power. &nbsp;<br><br>The first commercial electric power plant began operation in 1882 next to Wall Street in Manhattan, triggering the second industrial revolution of electricity, capitalism, and information technologies. This global revolution brought with it an instinct of “supply and demand” to energy, where additional energy could be supplied whenever desired by adding more coal to the fire.&nbsp;<br><br>In a post fossil-fuel era, our instinct must change again since renewable sources such as solar and wind do not supply in response to our demand, providing energy abundantly but chaotically. Our relationship with energy will be increasingly like the one we have with the internet (e.g. On a bad day, there’s little power available and you can’t run your washing machine. On a good day, there’s plenty of power and you can charge your car).&nbsp;Another Moon attempts to demonstrate this emerging relationship with energy and help its audience to create new instincts. By using the irregular energy source of a clear sunny sky to power a spectacle, the spectacle must interact with an unpredictable environment and is decoupled from our demand and control. This rhythm runs in contrast to that of the coal mine where the project was presented.

All of this, while you learn the tools they've employed to envision our futures in space. Plus, Nahum will provide hands-on guidance as you develop your own space and art project.\nYou will learn how artists from various disciplines and across history envisioned humanity's journey beyond Earth. Even before space travel was possible, artists were already creating the artworks that inspired both scientists and engineers to make space travel possible. The aim of this masterclass is to highlight the importance of these types of artworks and to develop new ideas for humanity's journey in the Cosmos.\nThe masterclass is designed to equip you with the theory and practical aspects of space and art projects. You will gain deep insights into the historical relationship between art, culture, and space throughout history. From ancestral cultural expressions to contemporary approaches to space and art.\nFor more than a decade, Nahum has worked extensively with space agencies around the world, conducting space missions for artistic purposes, including zero gravity flights and the installation of the first interactive artwork in the International Space Station. With his experience, you will be supported in conceiving and producing your own space and art project. He will present the different strategies you can use to access the international space community, use space technologies, and collaborate with scientists, engineers, astronauts, and space organisations.\nAt KOSMICA we believe that artists and creatives can directly contribute to developing new visions that will revolutionise space travel with kindness, compassion, and creativity, as well as exploring new ways to connect and experience the Cosmos.",

From economic models to space activities, from climate change to nation-states, we need to envision new possibilities and foster a culture of radical imagination. All of this because continuing to do things in the same way we always have is a sure recipe for disaster. We have created this programme because the solutions to current global challenges won't emerge from the same thinking that created them. Moreover, changes won’t come from one person, but instead will emerge from collective imagination and action.\nAt KOSMICA, we have developed a unique radical imagination methodology called the Black Canvas. This methodology is inspired by the tools and techniques used by the artists who envisioned space travel long before science and technology dared to dream it. We have taught this methodology in our programmes with space leaders and aspiring astronauts. Today, we want to share it with all members of our cosmic community.\nIn this course, we take participants on a creative journey and land in the middle of the Universe, a black arena where we can imagine new ideas, visions, models of co-existence and solutions away from the constraints on Earth.

This is a collaboration with the KOSMICA Institute and the Karlsruhe University of Arts and Design (HfG).\nIn summer 2021, the KOSMICA Institute created a space laboratory with artists from the Karlsruhe University of Arts and Design (HfG). In this laboratory they explored how artists have envisioned a myriad of models for exploring the universe in both critical and poetical ways. After a series of seminars and discussions with Nahum, artist and director of KOSMICA Institute, they have created a series of artworks to dialogue and expand on the projects presented at the pavilion, curated by Jan Boelen, artistic director of Atelier LUMA in France and rector of HfG.\nThe participating artists will present a selection of installations, interactive artworks and performances to create new imaginaries for the exploration of the cosmos and our relationship with it. This group of artists are stretching the possibilities of humans in space by envisioning cosmic portals, devising new extraterrestrial languages, queering our understanding of the universe and challenging our place in it. In the words of Nahum, ‘Today the role of art in space activities is crucial if we are going to be critical with our actions beyond our planetary home and to explore ways to be kind to the universe after having learned from our mistakes on Earth. Let’s remember that before space travel was possible, artists from different disciplines were already imagining humanity beyond Earth’s orbit. These cultural works inspired both scientists and engineers that made space travelling possible. Today, as the space sector grows, the role of imagination and creativity is even more important. Artists can directly contribute to shape the new technologies that will revolutionise space exploration.’\nPARTICIPATING ARTISTS\nMichael Bielicky\nÉva Csonka\nJuhee Han\nKimin Han\nAnna-Lina Helsen\nIden Sungyoung Kim\nJungeun Lee\nChristina Vinke\nAlex Wenger",

Before there were space programmes, artists throughout history fuelled the imagination for space travelling. Today artists are still creating new poetical and critical work about our role in space.\nIn the last years we have witnessed how space organisations and the industry are collaborating with the arts and humanities for producing work. At the same time we can see the birth of new independent groups and institutions that explore space from cultural perspectives.\nThis edition of KOSMICA in Paris will present the work of various members of the Committee for the Cultural Utilisation of Space (ITACCUS) of the International Astronautical Federation (IAF). Members of this committee have advocated for the importance of artists in their organisations and others have independently founded their own.

The first one is a large scale exhibition about artists working with meteorites.\nVerses of the Cosmos\n1863. A discovery in the field marks the history of a community in Sinaloa. The universe had thrown a metallic rock weighing about 20 tons on Earth. The settlers called it the ¨El Fierro¨ and today it is known as the Bacubirito Meteorite.\nThe Verses of the Cosmos (Versos del Cosmos) exhibition brings together a group of contemporary artists around this mythical meteorite to explore the mystery and astonishment that we have always had for these visitors from the universe through art. With a careful selection of artworks, the show explores these rocks from various poetic perspectives.\nThe exhibition invites us to remember that meteorites are more than just rocks: they are encrypted stories from other times and other spaces. They are also a testimony to the origin and fragility of life in our planetary home.\nToday, when it is more difficult to access dark skies and the natural world, feeling and rethinking our relationship with these celestial bodies reveals the intimate connection we have with the Cosmos.\nParticipating artists: Ale de la Puente, Amada Miller, Amor Muñoz, Daniel Llermaly, Diego Liedo, Emilio Chapela, Gilberto Esparza & Marcela Armas",
