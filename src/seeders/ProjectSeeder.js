                    ‘Transcosmogram’ is a materialised metaphor— a map obtained by highlighting tangents encompassing the multimodal stratum of knowledges—where we reimagine and reposition the human in the context of astronomy.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The notion of ‘transcosmogram’ emerged from the lack of depiction of dimensionalities in the human interpretation of space and the cosmos.
                    <br>
                    With the spirit of de-engtangling and composing all seemingly dividing boundaries, the intention of a ‘transcosmogram’ is to delineate a ‘’map’’ emerged from discovering and highlighting the tangents that connect these strata of our known space(s), i.e., consisting of the terrestrial and organic layers, e.g., sedimentary, atmospheric layers of the earth, and the technospheric layer, including space junk, and cosmological layers.
                    <br>
                    By tapping into the position and relationality between these layers/ elements and illustrating the relationships that exist within them, this approach emancipates us from our own prejudices regarding national, gender, economic, and other boundaries, fostering a sense of cosmic unity.

                The enchanting Earth is too-often made inhospitable to those marked as transgender. To survive we xenomogrify ourselves through social and biological technologies, altering our surfaces, our viscera, our molecular balances. None of us have been to space even if we possess somatic knowledges of deep bodily transformations, experiences that are necessary for extraterrestrial environments.
            </p>

                TX-1 launched bits of my hormone replacement medications to the International Space Station (ISS), marking the first-known time that elements of the transgender experience orbited the Earth. TX-1 includes a fragment of my spironolactone pill, a slice of my estradiol patch, and a miniature handmade paper sculpture, included to gesture towards the absent-yet-present xenoentities of the cosmos. A symbolic exodus to an orbit high above, the return of  TX-1 to Earth was also a sign of resilience, of not being disposed of, of coming back to thrive once again. 
            </p>
            <p>
                TX-1 flew to the ISS as part of the Sojourner 2020 project of the MIT Space Exploration Initiative, which provided the launch opportunity to nine artist-groups who were selected from an international open call. You truly never go to space alone.

            <p>
                While space is, in many ways, one of the most inhospitable places for life, it simultaneously holds an aura—naïve, perhaps—as a place of transformation where the usual constraints of life on earth can be refashioned, where those who are tranxxeno can exist without earthly prejudices. Some early trans\* activism even expressed desires for connection with extraterrestrial beings, suggesting kinship predicated on being seen as alien. Such cosmological allies thus evince the yearning for acceptance of the Other. These stories that we tell about space are of course simultaneously stories that we tell about earth, and thus TX-1, in line with this earlier activism, manifests a dream of acceptance of the tranxxeno as we move through these transitioning times.

                There are a plethora of theories and data that remain two dimensional, all stacked on top of each other, unreachable from the general public. Sensorial (In)verse is an attempt to bridge this distance and produce an immersive experience of the novel astronomical observations visible for all. It is an installation that allows users to explore the movement of stars in the Orion constellation over time. It does this through gestural control and produces an interactive audio-visual representation of the data.

            <h3>Astronomical Data</h3>
            <p>
                Astrometry, the science of charting the sky, is one of the oldest branches of astronomy and a discipline in which Europe excels. The European Space Agency (ESA) pioneered space astrometry with the Hipparcos Mission (launched in 1989) and, more recently, with the Gaia Mission (launched in 2013). Gaia is a project initiated by ESA to produce a three-dimensional map of our Milky Way galaxy by charting the motions of a thousand million stars, their luminosity, composition and temperature. This mission aims to provide a more in depth knowledge about the origin of the universe as well as the evolutionary history of our galaxy. The data derived by Gaia provides novel positional and radial velocity measurements and enables us to fathom our positionality in this vast cosmos.
            </p><p>
                In order to make astronomical data be accessible for a broader audience, Sensorial (In)verse translates the data derived from ESA’s Hipparcos Mission (representative of the Gaia data for the initial prototype) in the form of an interactive installation and represents it in a multimedia framework. This astrometry representation would enable better understanding of the mapping of the life path of the clusters and much more awareness about earth’s positionality within the galaxy.

            Another Moon&nbsp;is a large-scale outdoor apparition that creates a technically sublime floating globe made from light in the sky. 40 towers collect the sun's energy during the day and project that light back into the sky at night, creating a second moon overhead where the beams tightly superimpose to create the three-dimensional form. The project was presented in the industrial ruins of the Zeche Zollverein (historically the most productive coal mine in Europe). The public artwork could be viewed up to 1km away, creating a focus to bring people back together in a post-corona era.&nbsp;<br><br>Each night the lasers turn off one by one as their batteries deplete, in relation to how much sunshine there was on that particular day. This mechanism replays the fragile energy of the day, unwinding our on-demand instinct for energy that became prevalent during the era of coal power. &nbsp;<br><br>The first commercial electric power plant began operation in 1882 next to Wall Street in Manhattan, triggering the second industrial revolution of electricity, capitalism, and information technologies. This global revolution brought with it an instinct of “supply and demand” to energy, where additional energy could be supplied whenever desired by adding more coal to the fire.&nbsp;<br><br>In a post fossil-fuel era, our instinct must change again since renewable sources such as solar and wind do not supply in response to our demand, providing energy abundantly but chaotically. Our relationship with energy will be increasingly like the one we have with the internet (e.g. On a bad day, there’s little power available and you can’t run your washing machine. On a good day, there’s plenty of power and you can charge your car).&nbsp;Another Moon attempts to demonstrate this emerging relationship with energy and help its audience to create new instincts. By using the irregular energy source of a clear sunny sky to power a spectacle, the spectacle must interact with an unpredictable environment and is decoupled from our demand and control. This rhythm runs in contrast to that of the coal mine where the project was presented.
