        ‘Transcosmogram’ is a materialised metaphor — a map obtained by highlighting tangents
        encompassing the
        multimodal stratum of knowledges—where we reimagine and reposition the human in the context of astronomy.

      </p>

      <p class="text-2">
        The notion of ‘transcosmogram’ emerged from the lack of depiction of dimensionalities in the human
        interpretation of space and the cosmos.

        With the spirit of de-engtangling and composing all seemingly dividing boundaries, the intention of a
        ‘transcosmogram’ is to delineate a ‘’map’’ emerged from discovering and highlighting the tangents that connect
        these strata of our known space(s), i.e., consisting of the terrestrial and organic layers, e.g., sedimentary,
        atmospheric layers of the earth, and the technospheric layer, including space junk, and cosmological layers.

        By tapping into the position and relationality between these layers/ elements and illustrating the relationships
        that exist within them, this approach emancipates us from our own prejudices regarding national, gender,
        economic, and other boundaries, fostering a sense of cosmic unity.

        These disparities and boundaries result from a lack of shared knowledge of space research. The limitations in
        the universal understanding of terrestrial and extraterrestrial concepts result in discrepancies between the
        terminology and their interpretations. In the contemporary convergence of nature entangled with technology, how
        can we use technology to investigate the apparent division between ‘terrestrial’ and ‘extraterrestrial’?

        Exploring gravitational/ radio waves in space as well as in earth observation research as a metaphor/ case study
        through a transdisciplinary approach may facilitate an inception into interpreting phenomena that are
        perceivable in both cosmic and ground-based research.

        The significance of art in space research could facilitate unlearning associations collectively, only in
        conversation with representatives from different disciplines can we redefine space research and explore its
        potential engagement and implementation in other sectors.

        Art may be a portal of imagining exploration without the intention of colonisation.

      <p class="text-2">
        Science and art are cultures in their own right, and space is an infrastructure that has already been interwoven
        into our existence. There is no barrier; the barrier is the limitation or lack of knowledge about the processes
        in which they occur. As evolving transterrestrial beings, a collective cultural satellite as a space monument
        could be a symbol of unity beyond social, technospheric, and cosmological boundaries, synthesising and
        commemorating an inclusive space culture.
