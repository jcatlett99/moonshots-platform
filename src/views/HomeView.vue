          text: "A course for the educators of Tec de Monterrey in Mexico. From the history of space and art to the wisdom of shamanism. From nurturing radical imagination to queering the cosmos, this course aimed to spark creativity and expand our imaginations.\nIn this course, we will explore the profound visions of artists and creatives across diverse disciplines, who envisioned humanity's odyssey into the cosmos long before the advent of space travel. These imaginative works not only preceded the era of space programmes but also served of inspiration for the very scientists and engineers who would eventually transform those dreams into reality. Through these sessions, we aim to learn from art to forge new pathways for both our cosmic journey and our existence on Earth.\nIn a time when we need to reimagine our relationship with the planet, we invited the participants to move away from the inertia on Earth to imagine new ways of living in the cosmos with kindness and compassion.Using our Black Canvas framework, we ventured into the darkness of space to sketch anew the systems of care and coexistence we need in our planetary home."

Contemplating the stars and the sun's position through time has created an awareness of the universe in which we live. It has given birth to cultural expressions that have helped us make sense of our own existences.\nWith the advent of space technologies, rockets, robots, and orbiting machines, a new era has begun, where for many, space seems merely a critical territory to be colonised and profited from. As we become accustomed to the visions of colonies in space and the commercialisation of space resources, we ask for a moment of pause.\nThis workshop questions this way of exploiting the universe and invites participants to reflect on our original connection to it. Through sensory experiences and writing, participants will embark on a journey to decolonise/de-extractivise our connection to the sky and rediscover our cosmic ancestry.\nDon't miss this unique opportunity to delve into the depths of our cosmic past and the possibilities of our cosmic future. Let's journey together to reconnect with the universe in a profound and meaningful way.\nYour senses will be stimulated: smell, vision, sound, taste, and touch."},
